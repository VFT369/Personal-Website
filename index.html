                        Hacker & Cybersecurity Researcher. <br>
                        Creator, Developer, and Artist. I'm on a quest to combine My craft
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I've always been captivated by technology and curious to understanding how things work - Even if it meant dismantling my Christmas toys
                        to figure them out
                        However, I owe my journey into hacking to my brother.
                        <br>
                        He once accused me of 'hacking' his phone, when he'd simply forgotten his PIN. 
                        <br>
                        At the time, I couldn't recover the PIN, but, with his permission, i foctory-reset and wiped his phone using Android System Recovery.
                        <br>
                        I remeber it so vividly how my mother, brother and I were gathered around the green and black screen, and 
                        the iconic Android robot as I reset the phone.
                        <br>
                        It would still take a few years before I discovered cybersecurity and became an actual hacker, but eversince it was destined.
                        <br>
                        He spoke it into existence.
